A collection of webwork problems to complement Applied Discrete Structures

This is a collection of WeBWork problems that are organized to complement Applied Discrete Structures.
With the exception of a handful of problems that were coded by the author, these come from the National
Problem Library (NPL). In this first phase there are some sections that have no problems, while a few
probably have too many. I'll continue to mine the NPL and intend to start developing some problems in
the uncovered sections. If anyone would like to contribute problems, it would be greatly appreciated.
